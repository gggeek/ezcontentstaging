eZ Content Staging Extension
============================

The goal of the extension is to allow content synchronization between different eZ Publish installations.

The general architecture is the following:

Feeds
-----
. on the source server, "synchronization feeds" are defined
. every feed is used to relay content to one target server
. for every feed, a set of "root nodes" has to be defined
. every content that is a child of one of the feed root nodes will be synchronized to the target server
. the same content can be part of many feeds that synchronize to different target servers

Content editing
---------------
. the extension aims to synchronize content with a 100% accuracy, including e.g. objects states, sections, multiple locations etc...
. whenever a content is edited on the source server, the changes are recorded locally in the database (not sent immediately)
. editors and administrators can decide which contents to synchronize, via either the website toolbar (frontend), a dashboard panel or a dedicated page in the administration interface

Communication between the servers
---------------------------------
. the communication between the source and target servers happens via REST calls
. the extension needs to be installed on both source and target servers

FAQ
---
. q: can a feed be defined on a subtree of already existing content? a: not yet. It is recommended to have no content for either source or target feed sources
. q: can content sync happen immediately without intervention of the editor? a: not yet
. q: can content sync happen via a cronjob? a: yes
. q: are all datatypes supported? a: the extension support all datatypes from eZ Publish, plus datatypes that support fully toString(), fromString() calls
. q: is the REST protocol used for communication between the two servers documented? a: yes. It is in fact a "preview" version of the protocol that will be the official next version of the ezrest api
. q: how does the extension cope with synchronization of "dictionary" data, such as sections, object states, content class definitin? a: so far, this is left to manual synchronization
